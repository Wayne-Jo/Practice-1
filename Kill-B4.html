<p> Our world isn't going a way we like. In a word, there is one more insane existence
  rather than the series of B, which is Mr.Ma.
  As you can see from the picture above, even its appearance looks seriously odd and despicable.
  Although having fairly kind personality originally, it has mutated into nearly a monster.
  Whilst it has grown to date, having lost all the intelligence, which made it unable to think like human.
  It also has a very strong obsession for female, longing for any kind of affection from the counterpart gender.
  Therefore, if the project that make B and Ma be together for their whole lives,
  many females can survive from the likely curse from them.
  or, at least one of them must be dead for living at last.
