<h2>Get rid of VINS near its habitat</h2>

<p>The killing part might be getting rid of its refuge.
  The refuge is called "VINS" where he can fuel himself by drinking various liquors.
  It seems quite strange though, a few group of the insanes are backing him up,
  so that he can rest and recover mentally as well.
  The chief there is Mr. VIN, the former pirate captain is pretending being very usual person,
  even if his internal way of thinking went too far from the commonsense or standard way of usual people.
  This environment can support the B's vicious plan in any way, the necessity of destroying it is arising.
