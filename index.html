<p>"What's he saying by series of Bs?" from which your question start its own journey.
  So let me briefly introduce about what that looking horrible B means in our lives.
  B actually originated from the legendary psychic patient, the Sick-B, who was the object of horror for many persons in Seoul, South Korea.
  No information on how it was initially created, but the thing is "it really sucks the world in a ridiculously bad way".
  It was found that it has had an effect of infection in terms of making people encountering it going out of their minds.
  The existence has been enhanced in line with its strengthened ability of endless speaking.
  For now, it has turned into the real monster which doesn't even need to breathe.
  It finally infected a frequent visitor in VINS-the place of Oksu peace agreement.
  That infected person is named B.Jeon.
  So our quest has just begun here. Before it starts to raise the number of infected object,
  The heir should be terminated for no more damage in the devine space, Oksu.
  The writer, Wayne.J (1990), listed several resolutions to tackle this issue on this website.
  Appreciating for his endeavour, let's just start learning the solutions.
