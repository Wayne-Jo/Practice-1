<p>It is the baddest motherfucker in the whole world and unbelievably selfish,
  <br>then everyone who've ever met it before must be willing to remove it from our precious shelter, the Earth.
  <br>Some might say it even doesn't have that much meaning to kill it as more valuable things to do are always being around us.
  <br>Despite it, it indeed turns out that the sooner one kills it, the better the world would be.
  <br>The simplest way of removing it from here would surely be just shooting it with any sort of iron/metal stuff.
  <br>Nonetheless, the iron, as we all know, can be used for another efficent usage at some points in the future,
  <br>that means that we may waste the valuable resource for human, even though it seems not having that much value.
